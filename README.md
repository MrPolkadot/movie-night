# MOVIE NIGHT
## User Story
* As a Individual that loves movies but can never choose one, I wanted a website that helps me choose my movies for me. So that I'm not spending hours on end trying to figure out what movie I should watch.
* The website was created to generate a random movie by selecting the preferred Rating/Genre and then of a click of a button will pick the Movie that relates to what you want to watch.
* We wanted to help indecisive Individuals choose a movie that goes into the catagory that they prefer by a click of a button.
